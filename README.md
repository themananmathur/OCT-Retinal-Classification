# OCT Retinal Classification using Deep Learning 🧠🩺

This project focuses on the automated classification of retinal abnormalities from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

# Datasets Used

- OCTID: Multi-class dataset with 5 retinal classes  
- OCTDL: Binary dataset with Normal and Abnormal classification  
- (Future Work) OCT5k: Multi-disease and multi-graded dataset

# Models Trained

- `DenseNet121`
- `MobileNetV2`
- `EfficientNetV2B2`
- `Swin Transformer`

> All models trained with 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation, class weighting, learning rate schedulers, and extensive augmentation.

# Results

- EfficientNetV2B2 (OCTID): ~90.3% Accuracy  
- EfficientNetV2B2 (OCTDL): ~92.7% Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports saved in `/logs/`

# Model Weights

All trained model weights hosted on Hugging Face:
